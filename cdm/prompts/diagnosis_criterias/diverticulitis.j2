To diagnose diverticulitis consider the following criteria: General symptoms typically encompass abdominal pain, primarily in the left lower quadrant (LLQ), along with fever, and nausea or vomiting. During a physical examination, a patient may display tenderness in the LLQ, fever, and signs of peritonitis. Laboratory tests often reveal signs of inflammation and infection, which may include an elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Imaging findings often include bowel wall thickening, diverticula, inflammation, or abscesses around the affected segment of the colon.
