To diagnose appendicitis consider the following criteria: General symptoms usually include pain around the naval that shifts to the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of the abdomen, accompanied by fever and nausea or vomiting. During a physical examination, a patient might show RLQ tenderness, positive rebound tenderness, or signs of peritonitis. Laboratory tests may reveal signs of an inflammatory response, such as an elevated white blood cell count and elevated C-reactive protein levels. Imaging may disclose an enlarged appendix or possibly an appendicolith.
