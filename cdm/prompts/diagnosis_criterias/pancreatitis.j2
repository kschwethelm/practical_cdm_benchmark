To diagnose pancreatitis consider the following criteria: General symptoms usually include abdominal pain, primarily in the epigastric region, along with nausea or vomiting. During a physical examination, a patient might display epigastric tenderness, fever, and signs of jaundice. Laboratory tests may reveal signs of inflammation, such as elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, and pancreatic damage, indicated through heightened Amylase or Lipase levels. Further lab tests of hematocrit, urea nitrogen, triglycerides, calcium, sodium and potassium can indicate the severity of the disease. Imaging may show inflammation of the pancreas or fluid collection.
