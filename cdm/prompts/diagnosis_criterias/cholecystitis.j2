To diagnose cholecystitis, consider the following criteria: General symptoms usually include pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) of the abdomen, fever, and nausea. During a physical examination, a patient might display RUQ tenderness or indications of jaundice. Laboratory tests may reveal signs of inflammation, such as elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, liver damage, indicated through heightened Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) or Asparate Aminotransferase (AST) levels, or gallbladder damage, indicated through heightened Bilirubin or Gamma Glutamyltransferase levels. Imaging may show gallstones, thickened gallbladder walls, pericholecystic fluid, and a distended gallbladder.
